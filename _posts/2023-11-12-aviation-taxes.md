Aviation is all but exempt from tax. Read [this report](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b1c6cdd-88d3-11e9-9369-01aa75ed71a1) from the European Commission (EC).

(The source for the image above is the report by the EU.)

There is no VAT for international passengers. In Portugal, the great majority of domestic flights are also exempt from VAT (including flights to, from, and in between islands). Flights within the mainland are taxed at the minimum VAT bracket of 6%.

This is unacceptable. Coffee is taxed at 13% and cellphones at 23%. At this day and age, we all need a phone. On the other hand, consider the financial profile of those who frequently take the plane.

Let me know if i'm wrong. Otherwise, let's try and change this. Let rich polluters (among whom i count myself) take some of the tax load off from the rest.


Cheers,
